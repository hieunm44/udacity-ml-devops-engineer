# Deploying a ML Model to Cloud Application Platform with FastAPI
Course 3 - Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
* Github repo: https://github.com/hieunm44/deploying-a-ML-model-with-FastAPI

## Overview
In this project, you will apply the skills acquired in this course to develop a classification model on publicly available Census Bureau data. You will create unit tests to monitor the model performance on various data slices. Then, you will deploy your model using the FastAPI package and create API tests. The slice validation and the API tests will be incorporated into a CI/CD framework using GitHub Action.
